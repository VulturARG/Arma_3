1 - To use this interface on any device or panel, put the "TV" folder in your
mission folder and add the following to your description.ext :


class CfgSounds
{
// List of sounds (.ogg files without the .ogg extension)
sounds[] = {rap,house,rock,bip,bip2};

// Definition for each sound
class rap
{
// Name for mission editor
name = "rap"; 
//Path of the .ogg file. since it's in the same folder just use the filename
sound[] = {TV\Media Player\Music\rap.ogg, 1, 1.0}; 
titles[] = {};
};
class house
{
// Name for mission editor
name = "house"; 
//Path of the .ogg file. since it's in the same folder just use the filename
sound[] = {TV\Media Player\Music\house.ogg, 1, 1.0}; 
titles[] = {};
};
class rock
{
// Name for mission editor
name = "rock"; 
//Path of the .ogg file. since it's in the same folder just use the filename
sound[] = {TV\Media Player\Music\rock.ogg, 1, 1.0}; 
titles[] = {};
};
class bip
{
// Name for mission editor
name = "bip"; 
//Path of the .ogg file. since it's in the same folder just use the filename
sound[] = {TV\TV logo & beep\Sounds\bip.ogg, 1, 1.0}; 
titles[] = {};
};
class bip2
{
// Name for mission editor
name = "bip2"; 
//Path of the .ogg file. since it's in the same folder just use the filename
sound[] = {TV\TV logo & beep\Sounds\bip2.ogg, 1, 1.0}; 
titles[] = {};
};

};


2 - After that, name "tv" the device where you want to use the interface, and
add the following in the object init field :


     tv addAction ["Turn ON", "TV\tv-init.sqf"];


3 - Create an invisible object, like an invisible helipad, and name it "media_player"


VERY IMPORTANT : - Never launch more than one video at the same time,it will lag
                   very hard and it's impossible to stop a video so you have to
                   wait for it to finish before starting another one.
                   
                 - When using Media Player, you also have to wait for a song to 
                   finish before starting another but this time you will be able
                   to stop it.
                   
                 

If you want to add more functionality to this interface, you will have to add
actions or replace the ones present and associate a content to them in 
"openMyscriptname.sqf" located in eachapplication "Scripts" folder, to make 
everything easier to use, both actions and related content will have the same name.


For example, in the Facebook folder :

If you want to change the first action for something like View friend request,
You will change the following: 

 -in "TV\Facebook\Scripts\openFacebook.sqf", go to the line :  tv addAction ["Open home page", "TV\Facebook\Scripts\action1.sqf"];

 -Replace "Open home page" by the action of your choice, in this example :  tv addAction ["View friend request", "TV\Facebook\Scripts\action1.sqf"];

 -Don't change anything else, after that simply replace the related content by the media of your choice, in this example : replace "action1.jpg" located in "TV\Facebook\Pictures" folder by your file but rename it action1.

 -In this example it was a picture but it can be any type of media.

 -Always give the same name to both your content and action sqf file.

The same applies to Youtube, Twitter, Verizon FIOS and others applications, just follow the example given.

You can put as many content as you want if you do this correctly, there is no limit at all.

It works with all devices : TV, tablet, smartphones, computers and even with huge panels.
