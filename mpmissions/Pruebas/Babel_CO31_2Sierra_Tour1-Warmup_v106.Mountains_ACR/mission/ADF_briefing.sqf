<font color='#9DA698'>
Two Sierra Tour 1 | Takistan, May 2019. On 11 February 2019 the Taliban ceased to exist after a coalition forces UAV successfully targeted and killed the entire Taliban leadership council. The majority of Taliban fighters joined The Pashtun within the following weeks.
<br/><br/></font>

<font size='14' color='#d7dbd5'>THE PASHTUN</font><br/>

<font color='#9DA698'>
The Pashtun are a race of warriors who originate from Afghanistan, Takistan and Pakistan. The Pashtun consists of about sixty tribes, each with its own territory.<br/><br/>

The Pashtun has rapidly been expanding its foothold in Asia and the Middle East after the fall of the Taliban, and previously the fall of IS and other factions. The Pashtun are well funded, moderately well organized and very ambitious. Little is known about their goals as they keep a low public relations profile. Intelligence agencies are busy mapping the Pashtun organization. So far reliable intelligence is scares at best.<br/><br/>

CSAT has on several occasions tried to open diplomatic channels. Up till now the Pashtun and CSAT are maintaining neutral relations. Allied Command Operations (ACO) is monitoring the CSAT/Pashtun situation closely.<br/><br/>
Currently The Pashtun are moderately armed with mostly small arms and 2nd generation RPG’s. The BBC reported last week that The Pashtun are in progress of purchasing Iranian-made APC’s and M-ATV’s.
